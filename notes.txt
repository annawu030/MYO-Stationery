off the top of my head, there should be CSS properties that will let us:
* define the maximum height (and width) of some element (max-height? and max-width?)
* toggle whether the elements inside an element will scroll
* toggle whether the scrollbar shows or not (there's one for vertical and one for horizontal)



what elements do we want to stay on the screen at all times? Do we want the nav to scroll out of view [insert rant about sites that do this]? What if we have the nav float all the time but it appears giant [insert rant about sites that have this]?
