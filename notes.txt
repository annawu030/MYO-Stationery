off the top of my head, there should be CSS properties that will let us:
* define the maximum height (and width) of some element (max-height? and max-width?)
* toggle whether the elements inside an element will scroll
* toggle whether the scrollbar shows or not (there's one for vertical and one for horizontal)



what elements do we want to stay on the screen at all times? Do we want the nav to scroll out of view [insert rant about sites that do this]? What if we have the nav float all the time but it appears giant [insert rant about sites that have this]?



need to look up how various langs handle input elements with the same name--can we get them to send together? e.g. have something like "getName("toprint")" return "[true, false, true, true, false, false]" (example refers to print.html)
preliminary search tells me it varies by language, especially for PHP; I think we'll just need to look at Javascript though

For the browse page, my first thought is that we add tags as CSS classes and then toggle those classes as visible or hidden. And we might want to have all the checkboxes checked by default
